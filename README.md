Angular Todo App
================

Practice building an Angular Todo app via the tutorial on http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular.  

This project will use the MEAN architecture stack.  

M === mongodb
E === express
A === angularjs
N === nodejs

================
Since I followed the tutorial a lot of the code was generated by hand.  There are a few boilerplate projects which will help with the initial configuration e.g. http://mean.io/ or try searching for a yeoman generators http://yeoman.io/community-generators.html
