# Angular Todo App
================

Practice building an Angular Todo app via the tutorial on http://scotch.io/tutorials/javascript/creating-a-single-page-todo-app-with-node-and-angular.  

This project will use the MEAN architecture stack.  

| Letter | Description |
| ------ | ---- |
| M | mongodb - http://www.mongodb.org/ |
| E | express - http://expressjs.com/ |
| A | angularjs - http://angularjs.org/ |
| N | nodejs - http://nodejs.org/ |

## Boilerplate Projects to Setup environment
================
Since I followed the tutorial a lot of the code was generated by hand.  There are a few boilerplate projects which will help with the initial configuration e.g. http://mean.io/ or try searching for a yeoman generators http://yeoman.io/community-generators.html

# Run Application
===
Have node and npm installed.
From node command prompt and within project directory run the following: 
	node server.js

# Application Structure
===

## server.js
===
	This is the file where we will:
 		* Configure our application
 		* Connect to our database
 		* Create our Mongoose models
 		* Define routes for our RESTful API
 		* Define routes for our frontend Angular application
 		* Set the app to listen on a port so we can view it in our browser
